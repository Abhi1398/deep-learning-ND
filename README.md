## Project 3: TV Script Generation
[project-tv-script-generation](project-tv-script-generation)<br/>

In this project, I generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The dataset used to train the network consists of scripts from 9 Seinfeld seasons. After training on the dataset, the RNN can create a new, "fake" TV script.
